[The Art of Product Management with Sachin Rekhi (ENG’05 W’05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huTSPanUlQM)

What do Product Managers DO ?
Product managers drive the vision, strategy , design and execution of their  product. 

### VISION : 

A compelling vision articulates how the world will be a better place if you succeed.  

Articulating -> Inspiring -> Have Sync in 

Example : "It is important that humanity becomes an interplanetary species". Elon Musk, SpaceX

### STRATEGY  :

Example : "Your margin is my opportunity". Jeff Bezos, Amazon

A compelling strategy details exactly how you will dominate the market  

A vision should be stable, bu your strategy needs to be iterated on and refined until you find the product/market fit. 

Ditch the business plan ; instead focus on a few-page summary that captures each of your critical product/market fet hypotheses. 

The Product/Market fit Hypotheses 

1. Target Audience 
    Bull's Eye  -  Think about the center of the Bull's Eye . 
2. Problem you are Solving 
    Nice to Need to have 
3. Value Propositions
    Not feature list but the promise to customer of the value that will be generated 
4. Strategy Differentiation
    Provide at least 10X improvement/better because the cost of switching solution and mental inertia to even bother is os high that  product with 2X and 3X get passed on. 
5. Competition 
    Direct (existing Market) and Indirect customer (New Market) 
6. Acquisition Strategy 
7. Monetization Strategy 
8. KPIs
    Define KPIs is MUST

- Minimize your dimensions of Innovation - Be selected  
- Innovate on few dimensions and use best practices for the rest.

### DESIGN : 

A compelling design delivers a useful, usable and delightful experience to your customers 

Delight  : 
- By bringing emotional intelligence to your product design. 

Start by falling in love with the problem you are solving for your target customers .. But not .. with the solution . 

[Develop Personas](http://www.sachinrekhi.com/the-importance-of-developing-personas-in-product-design)  : Personas are fictional characters developed to represent the different archetypes of users of your product . 

Increase Exposure Hours  - 

Deliver delight by adding a desired emotion dimension to your product design process.

* Dimension of Delight and Design 

Example : "You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple". Steve Jobs, Apple

### EXECUTION : 
Example : "We do it really, really fucking good". Stewart Butterfield, Slack  

*Whatever it takes  ?
* Constant calibrating 

Execution Loop  : 
* Define -> Validate - > iterate 

* Define your hypotheses 
* Validate each hypotheses 
* iterate  based on what you have learned 


#### Decision Making 
Fast iteration requires clear decisions right 
-  who owns this decision ?
But.. not shortcut for building share context

Establish yourself as the curator, not the creator of great ideas.

Favor decisions today over decisions tomorrow. The enemy of decision-making is time.

New information triggers revisiting decision 

#### Velocity 

Reward engineering velocity over elegance 
 Instead of rewarding teams with elegant architectural solutions to yesterday's problems Reward teams that are moving fast enough to solve today's customer challenges 

#### Invest in Retrospectives : 
Improve your ability to accurately forecast (and ultimately improve) engineering cost and product outcome estimates through post-sprint retrospective 

#### Metrics : Learn to Read the Matrix 
Build your intuition ofr metrics by spending time every dat to reviewing a few critical acquisition, engagement and moetization dashboards .

In relation to Product Delivery 

|Product Discovery | Product Delivery |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Deciding What to build  | Building it  |
| Goal : TO learn Fast | Goal : Ship Fast |
|   *  Are we meeting stakeholder needs ? | Annually  - > Daily 
|   *  Can customer use it  ? | * CI
|   *  Do customers want our solution | 
|   * Are we solving a problem customers care about ? |
|   *  Are we a driving towards a desired outcome **|



Product Management in 
2000 :
-  Waterfall Model  : 
   Spends Months Gathering Requirement in Large PDR and  Sent to Engineers to built it -> Packaged and shipped to store in CD 
2001 : - Release of Agile Manifesto 
      - Are we building products that our internal business  stakeholder wants 
      - Are we building products that our customer know how to use 
      - Rise of User Experience Design and Design thinking

* Do customers want our solution ?
* Are we solving the right problem for our customer ?
   
        
Book  :

- What customer want (Anthony K Ulwick )
- Jobs to be Done

We should not be obsessed with feature but what outcome are we creating for our customer and business. Move from focus from output to focus on outcome (Impact), improving value of my business 


** Are we a driving towards a desired outcome **
As a product team my goal is to 
 - Increase Revenue 
 - Decrease Churn 
 - Increase engagement 
 - Increase customer satisfaction 
 - Increase NPS score 


 * How to conduct good Customer Interview ?
 * How to run sound experiments  ?
 * How to draw good conclusion from those research activities?  

The Opportunity Solution Tree 
- Define a clear Desired outcome  {How are we measuring that and when I am done}
- Discover Opportunities to Drive the desired Outcome 
    How we frame the problem has a profound impact on the types and quality of solutions we can generate 
- Discover Solutions that Deliver on those Opportunities 


Evaluate New Methods :
- Does it help me learn faster 
- What does it help me to learn faster

| 5 whys if necessary | Don't challenge|

### 2. Simplify your Decision

## 30 Things You'll Learn as a PM in 30 Minutes by HubSpot PM

[Dylan Sellberg  : Hubspot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52ChZRinTiI)
###  Learning are not lessons
### Product Development 
    1. Product Management is not a Science .  (Ambiguity)
    2. Product Development is a lot like Science. 
    3. Bringing something new to market is the very beginning of product's lifecycle, not the end.
    4. Small features, specific audiences, big wins. 
    5. Paying down tech debt > most things 
    6. Things break . Don't panic. Give your team space and autonomy to solve the problem . Provide air cover if possible . 
    7. If you try to  solve for 100% of your customers, you'll end up solving for 0 %
    8. Deadline spur action.
    9. It's not possible to define what's a high priority if you don't understand the low priorities. 
    10. Speed is a bug . Speed is a feature. 

### Your Team
    11. A little process goes a long way. (What are biggest priority , we building , we ignoring ) 
    12. If a team has even slightly different definitions of what you're building , it's nearly impossible to get 13. shit done . (Define what and why )
    14. "Passing along" a bulk of customer feedback means nothing unless it's clearly synthesized/ bucketed and tied to potential solutions.  (impact for customer)
    15. A team that understands every product is iterative is emphatically more powerful than one working towards as "end" game.  (There is no perfect Software).
    16. A team that literally sprints at fires is the most powerful thing on planet Earth.
    17. An excellent metaphor can be the key to communicating a highly complex problem .
    18. Team happiness and product success are directly correlated.
### The Craft  
    19. Conveying ideas in writing is infinitely more effective than conveying them across sporadic conversations for both the conveyor and the consumer. Write stuff down .  (Write and make it public)
    20.Sometime you're the hammer and sometimes you're the nail.
    21. When deciding between one or the other, try both. 
    22. When you need to communicate something important, communicate  3X more than you need to . Then do it again . When you think people have finally gotten your message communicate more.
    23. When it comes to getting buy in, evidence > ideas.
    24. Python is the bee's knees. 
    25. Sitting for lunch with 5 people on the services team will fill your notepad quicker than 10 customer calls .
    26. Toying around with another potentially unrelated, product could be all that's standing between you and a breakthrough idea for your own product .  
    27. The deeper you go into a data set, the more unexpected (and surprisingly valuable ) things you'll learn .

Risk Mitigation  :
  There are Known Knowns - things we know that we know 
  There are Known unknowuns  - things that we know we don't know
  But there are also unknown Unknowns - things we don't know we don't know

==================== 

How did we get here  :

	- Build customer empathy and choose a problem which is really painful 
	- Figure out what customers really care about  . 
		* The MOM Test 
	-Think about end to end experience - You are responsible for every touchpoint, there is no 'this is someone's else job' .
	- How do I know I'm going in the right direction ?
		* If promoter> detractor  (you will grow)
