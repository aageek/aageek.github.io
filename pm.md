## 30 Things You'll Learn as a PM in 30 Minutes by HubSpot PM

[Dylan Sellberg  : Hubspot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52ChZRinTiI)
###  Learning are not lessons
### Product Development 
    1. Product Management is not a Science .  (Ambiguity)
    2. Product Development is a lot like Science. 
    3. Bringing something new to market is the very beginning of product's lifecycle, not the end.
    4. Small features, specific audiences, big wins. 
    5. Paying down tech debt > most things 
    6. Things break . Don't panic. Give your team space and autonomy to solve the problem . Provide air cover if possible . 
    7. If you try to  solve for 100% of your customers, you'll end up solving for 0 %
    8. Deadline spur action.
    9. It's not possible to define what's a high priority if you don't understand the low priorities. 
    10. Speed is a bug . Speed is a feature. 

### Your Team
    11. A little process goes a long way. (What are biggest priority , we building , we ignoring ) 
    12. If a team has even slightly different definitions of what you're building , it's nearly impossible to get 13. shit done . (Define what and why )
    14. "Passing along" a bulk of customer feedback means nothing unless it's clearly synthesized/ bucketed and tied to potential solutions.  (impact for customer)
    15. A team that understands every product is iterative is emphatically more powerful than one working towards as "end" game.  (There is no perfect Software).
    16. A team that literally sprints at fires is the most powerful thing on planet Earth.
    17. An excellent metaphor can be the key to communicating a highly complex problem .
    18. Team happiness and product success are directly correlated.
### The Craft  
    19. Conveying ideas in writing is infinitely more effective than conveying them across sporadic conversations for both the conveyor and the consumer. Write stuff down .  (Write and make it public)
    20.Sometime you're the hammer and sometimes you're the nail.
    21. When deciding between one or the other, try both. 
    22. When you need to communicate something important, communicate  3X more than you need to . Then do it again . When you think people have finally gotten your message communicate more.
    23. When it comes to getting buy in, evidence > ideas.
    24. Python is the bee's knees. 
    25. Sitting for lunch with 5 people on the services team will fill your notepad quicker than 10 customer calls .
    26. Toying around with another potentially unrelated, product could be all that's standing between you and a breakthrough idea for your own product .  
    27. The deeper you go into a data set, the more unexpected (and surprisingly valuable ) things you'll learn .

==================== 

How did we get here  :

	- Build customer empathy and choose a problem which is really painful 
	- Figure out what customers really care about  . 
		* The MOM Test 
	-Think about end to end experience - You are responsible for every touchpoint, there is no 'this is someone's else job' .
	- How do I know I'm going in the right direction ?
		* If promoter> detractor  (you will grow)
